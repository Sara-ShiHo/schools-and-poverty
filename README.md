# schools-and-poverty
A simple data cleaning, analysis and visualization exercise using R

 - Impute or remove missing data
 - Alter or remove outliers that don't make sense
 
 Through visualizations and simple linear regression, consider the following:
 - the relationship between test scores and free / reduced lunch programs
 - the relationship between test scores and local poverty levels
 - the pros and cons of using free / reduced lunch programs as a proxy for poverty
